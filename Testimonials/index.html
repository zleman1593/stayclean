              I am so pleased with the power washing that was done on our mobile home - looks so clean and sparkling like a new home. Spencer takes pride in his work and it most surely shows in his work ethic along with his polite, friendly and pleasant attitude. Bravo job done, indeed!<br />

              Spencer was professional, easy to work with, he gave us a accurate quote, and most importantly the quality of his work was amazing. My girlfriend and I are very happy with the way our house looks and we already spoke to Spencer about having him do this on an annual basis. I highly recommend Spencer and his company!<br />

              I had my double-wide mobile home and huge metal shed power washed today. Spencer took time to look at what needed to be done and I was indeed impressed at his work ethic, taking the time plus re-checking all that was cleaned. I paid him and he did not go in the truck immediately, no he re-checked areas, to make sure it was good and clean. He does take pride in his work and I will definitely tell my family and friends. The best advertisement is word of mouth, and he gets a gold star.<br />

              I recently had Stay Clean Power Washing clean my brick walk and patio. The results were beyond imaginable! Spencer Leman, was prompt, courteous and extremely professional. My son has also used this company to power wash homes that he has remodeled and has saved thousands of dollars that he would have had spent on painting the homes. Do not hesitate to call this young man. I would never recommend a company if I didn't fully believe in it.<br />

              Spencer rocks! What a great job! He is prompt and polite. My wife was told about him by a friend Cheryl Walsh but was a little worried I wouldn't like the job because she says I am too fussy, well Spencer passed the test with flying colors, thank you Spencer!<br />

              Stay Clean Power Washing (Spencer) did a fantastic job on power washing our house, patio, gutters, walkway and shed. Spencer is professional, polite, and prompt and has a superior work ethic. He really cares about his work and makes sure that the customers are satisfied. He even went above and beyond and power washed our pool storage boxes that were all green with algae free of charge. I will never have to look for another power washing company again as Stay Clean Power Washing will be my first and only call. Thanks again for making our house look brand new!!!!<br />

              I will NEVER have to look for another power washing company. I engaged Spencer to power wash my home, brick steps and chimney, deck and fence. He said he would make it look brand new.... And HE DID! He was thorough and meticulous in treating the problem areas, and the results were outstanding. As other homeowners have said, Spencer is prompt and polite, and extremely professional. I was greatly impressed by his superior work ethic and positive attitude, especially given my home was a work site that day for a few other contractors. I have engaged other "power washing" companies before, but no one has come close to what Spencer achieved. The pride in his work is self-evident. I am delighted with the results he has delivered. I know exactly who to call next time around. THANK YOU, Spencer!<br />
