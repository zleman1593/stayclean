                    Keeping your rain gutters free of debris and flowing properly is vital to the overall well‐being of your home and should be done twice a year, especially if you live around a wooded area with many trees. Clogged gutters full of rainwater can cause a number of problems, including mold, foundation leaks and cracks, basement flooding, damage to your wood siding/vinyl siding and winter ice dam build‐up ‐ all of which could cost you thousands of dollars in repairs. Stagnant water sitting in your gutters is also a breeding ground for a multitude of bugs and insects that carry potentially dangerous diseases like West Nile Virus.

                    You care about your home looking its best. If your driveway, walkway or other surfaces are dirty, your curb appeal will suffer. Even worse than that, your unprotected concrete is much more likely to get stained and damaged. This damage can happen in the winter when water moisture gets into the pores of the unsealed surface of the concrete. The moisture then freezes and expands and cracks your concrete apart. In the spring you are then left with cracked and damaged concrete that needs to be replaced. Have Stay Clean Power Washing clean and seal your concrete for you to prevent costly future repairs. We specialize in cleaning all concrete surfaces from driveways, patios, and walkways, to front porches and more.

                    Dirt, stains, mildew, algae and environmental debris build up on a home, gradually dulling and fading the exterior.  This leaves the finish dull and tired-looking.  Cleaning the exterior discourages the growth of mold and mildew, both of which can cause allergic reactions and respiratory problems as well as deterioration of the surfaces that they live on creating hefty repair bills.
                    <br /><br />
                    Many homeowners consider power washing as the simple act of spraying (highly pressurized) water against their siding and compare it to a DIY project such as washing a car.  In most home exterior situations this is not the case.  More often, what is intended to be a small DIY job, turns into a day-long, weekend-long or uncompleted project requiring the timely and costly addition of supplies such as power washers, hoses, ladders, etc.  Even worse once this unintentionally costly and backbreaking work is over, the results simply will not compare to the work of a professional. Don’t spend your day off trying doing dirty and backbreaking labor.<br />
                    Numerous techniques are required for properly cleaning home exteriors and/or preparing for painting.  There are many causes for the staining that occurs and not all power washing contractors practice the same methods of cleaning.  As with other trades, homeowners and consumers should be selective when choosing providers to avoid service issues that result from improper washing procedures and/or inexperience.

                    <h3>Why is it so important to have your roof cleaned?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Roof cleaning is about more than just having a clean LOOKING roof. It is also about attending to the overall health of your roof and home. Roof mold, lichen and algae can be dangerous as they stealthily creep and grow underneath your shingles and act like a sponge soaking up water that can lead to leaks, shingle damage and costly repairs. <br />
                      The black streaks that you see on your roof are a result of a certain type of blue-green algae called Gloeocapsa Magma. If not treated in a timely manner, this algae will eventually begin to compromise the integrity of your shingles and lead to unexpected and costly roof repairs. <br />
                      The process typically begins as the algae spores land and attach to your roof from over hanging trees, birds, and or wind.  The algae consumes the limestone filler found in your shingle granules. The limestone filler acts as a food source for the algae allowing the algae to grow and eventually cover larger and larger sections of your roof. <br />
                      As the algae spreads it is literally eating your shingles!  If this is allowed to continue untreated, the algae will cause a loss of roof granules which are vital to the reflective properties of your roof. The loss of these granules leads to greater heat build up and roof leaks. This guarantees higher energy costs to and hefty repair bills for you.<br />
                    </p>

                    <h3>How can roof cleaning save you money?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Deteriorating shingles can take years off of the life of your roof.  A new roof can cost anywhere between $6,000 and $20,000 today. As a homeowner, why would you not want to do everything in your power to save money and protect your largest asset? A Stay Clean roof cleaning will help you to protect your home while also improving the overall look. Say goodbye to those ugly black streaks and green moss!  <br />
                      If you are placing your home on the market, a roof soft wash can increase your market value by nearly $10,000 to $20,000! <br />
                      Imagine this… A potential buyer pulls up to a beautiful looking home, but notices the roof is covered in black and green “stuff”.  Before the buyer has even stepped inside they may be questioning the integrity of the roof. A preconceived notion about potential costs associated with your roof could drive that buyer away in a hurry. Don’t be careless with your curbside appeal. A good first impression is fundamental to a successful sale.  Let Stay Clean help! <br />
                      Save money on roof repairs now! Don’t let lichen eat through your roof shingles like termites eat through wood. Nearly one out of every three roofs, are replaced because the homeowner was unaware that the roof could be cleaned. Stay Clean’s roof cleaning is very affordable.  However, the longer the algae goes untreated and is allowed to grow, the more costly the cleaning can be.  Call Stay Clean now!<br />

                    <h3>Typical Roof Cleaning Questions:</h3>
                    <b>Will the roof cleaning process damage my landscaping?</b><br />
                    No! Our cleaners are safe for grass, shrubs, pets and people.  However, they are very effective in killing all the algae and removing all the pollutants that cause the black streaks. Our detergents are diluted to such a point that they will have no impact on your landscaping.  Additionally we triple rinse all greenery (before, during and after).<br />
                    <b>Will cleaning my roof damage the shingles?</b><br />
                    When the wrong methods are used, the answer is yes. The main culprit of roof-cleaning damage is high-pressure, and walking on roofs. Stay Clean Power Washing uses a low-pressure system and state of the art hybrid lifts so we never have to step foot on your roof.<br />
                    <b>So, how do you clean my roof without causing damage?</b><br />
                    By using low-pressure methods recommended by the shingle manufacturers themselves.  The Asphalt Roofing Manufacturers Association, Owens Corning and GAF have all suggested cleaning methods and solutions to safely clean roofs suffering from roof algae.  They recommend using a low-pressure chemical application by a low-pressure rinse.<br />
                    <b>How long will my roof stay clean?</b><br />
                    Our roof cleaning process produces amazing results that will last several years.  It is very possible that your roof will become stained again over time due to the nature of our climate and the same algae-producing conditions - airborne algae spores, moisture on certain slopes of the roof and the limestone shingle filler.  We also coat every roof with our Mildew Preventative Treatment to help prolong the cleanliness and look of your roof.<br />
                    <b>Can you just clean off the few, black streaks on my roof?</b><br />
                    We have found that spot cleaning is ineffective and produces a poor aesthetic. Even minor stains or streaks on your roof indicate that your shingles have lost the ability to fight off the algae - the stains will spread as time passes and humidity increases.

                    An ice dam is caused then the heat escapes from your home through the roof causing the snow to melt. This melting snow/ water runs into the edge of your roof or your gutter where it freezes and causes a blockage, causing the ice to back up on your roof. A combination of cold and snow will cause an ice dam. The formation of large icicles is a warning sign that you could soon have an ice dam causing damage to your home. Many people think that simply knocking the icicles off or waiting for warmer weather will prevent ice dams from doing damage. However, this could not be further from wrong, once you have an ice dam it needs to be removed right away before it causes water and ice to back up under your shingles causing water damage in your house and costly roof repairs.<br />
                    Our trained team of professionals use a proven steam method to correctly remove the ice dams and roof snow to prevent any further damages to your home or residence. Don’t risk climbing up on the roof yourself and falling off. Call Stay Clean Power Washing to do the work for you as we have state of the art steam equipment and hybrid lifts to reach the tallest parts of your roof.
